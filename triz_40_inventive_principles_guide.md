# The 40 Inventive Principles of TRIZ: Concept & Modern Application Guide

## Executive Summary
The **Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ)**, developed by Genrich Altshuller and his colleagues, is a systematic methodology for solving engineering and design problems. At the heart of TRIZ are the **40 Inventive Principles**—a curated list of strategies extracted from the analysis of millions of patents. These principles represent the standard pathways that innovators use to resolve physical and technical contradictions.

This document analyzes each of the 40 principles, details their sub-sections, retains the original engineering and mechanical examples, and **enhances them with modern applications** spanning software engineering, cloud computing, modern hardware, electronics, medicine, and everyday life. Finally, it outlines the practical use and integration of these principles in modern product development.

## The 40 Inventive Principles

### Principle 1: Segmentation

*Original Engineering & Mechanical Examples:*
- Scarecrow
- Sound of a barking dog (with no dog) as a burglar alarm

## Practical Use & Application of TRIZ Principles

### 1. Identifying Technical Contradictions
A technical contradiction occurs when improving one parameter of a system (e.g., speed, weight, capacity) causes another parameter to degrade (e.g., energy consumption, reliability, complexity). Traditional engineering tries to compromise (trade-off). TRIZ aims to **eliminate the contradiction** entirely by selecting a relevant Inventive Principle.

### 2. Using the Contradiction Matrix
To apply these principles systematically:
1. **Identify the Improving Parameter:** What feature of the system do you want to make better? (Choose from Altshuller's 39 Standard Parameters, such as *Weight of moving object*, *Speed*, *Durability*).
2. **Identify the Worsening Parameter:** What feature degrades as a side-effect? (Choose another of the 39 parameters).
3. **Consult the Matrix:** Look up the intersection of the improving and worsening parameters in the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix.
4. **Apply Recommended Principles:** The matrix will suggest 2 to 4 Inventive Principles that have historically resolved this specific conflict. Use the guidelines and examples in this document to brainstorm implementations.

### 3. Resolving Physical Contradictions
A physical contradiction occurs when a single element needs to have opposite states at the same time (e.g., a software program must be complex to support features, but simple for user navigation; a bicycle helmet must be hard to resist impact, but soft to absorb shock).
Physical contradictions are resolved by separating the conflicting requirements:
- **Separation in Time:** (e.g., Principle 34: Discarding and Recovering — stitches that are solid during healing, but dissolve later).
- **Separation in Space:** (e.g., Principle 3: Local Quality — smartphone screen is glass, body is aluminum).
- **Separation between System Levels (Whole and Parts):** (e.g., Principle 1: Segmentation — microservices are simple individually, but make up a complex system).
- **Separation by Condition:** (e.g., Principle 35: Parameter Change — shape memory alloys that are flexible when cold and rigid when hot).

### 4. Integration into Modern Development (Agile & DevOps)
- **Refactoring:** Principle 1 (Segmentation) and Principle 2 (Extraction) are the basis of software refactoring—isolating modules, decoupling classes, and extracting utilities.
- **Continuous Delivery:** Principle 20 (Continuity of Useful Action) is realized through automated testing and deployment pipelines, reducing release latency to zero.
- **Resource Efficiency:** Principle 25 (Self-Service) and Principle 27 (Cheap Short-Living Objects) form the basis of serverless compute and ephemeral test environments, drastically reducing infrastructure costs.
